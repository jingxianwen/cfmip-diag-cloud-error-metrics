This is a set of scalar measures of model fidelity in simulating clouds, where the observational "truth" comes from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) cloud fields.  The four scalar measures of the fidelity of model cloud simulations are described in Section 4 of [http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~mzelinka/Klein_etal13.pdf Klein et al. (2013)]. 

* E_TCA measures fidelity in simulating total cloud amount. 
* E_CP measures fidelity in simulating cloud-top pressure and optical depth of optically intermediate and thick clouds at high, middle, and low-levels of the atmosphere. 
* E_SWCP measures the impacts of E_CP on top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation.
* E_LWCP measures the impacts of E_CP on top-of-atmosphere longwave radiation.

Greater fidelity with respect to ISCCP observations is represented by lower E values.
